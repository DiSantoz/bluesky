Upon entering the name of the city, the user is presented with the current weather forecast that displays the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and the UV Index:

The planner dynamically changes as the day progress. Any time in the past will display a grey color on the time slot, current time slots will be red and tasks in the future will be green.
